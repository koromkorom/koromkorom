- 👋 Hi, I’m @koromkorom

- 👀 I’m interested in cool agile projects using new technology. It would be easier to describe what I'm not interested in. I like pipelines and workflows, that are efficient. 
I like projects, in which people care for what they're doing. I'm good in cpp and python. I have experience with cloud computing, hosting and AI. For the most part I worked in robotics, 
which I am still interested in, but I'm also open to try something new. I'm also interested in ethics. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning flutter, javascript and CI/CD. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything as long as it's fun and meaningful.
